      <h1>Rishika Sur</h1>
        <p>I'm a common nerdy Information Technology major who spends her day toggling between classes, practicing coding and 
            working on projects. The fact that I have survived without coffee (or any other caffeinated product) should be an
          achievement on itself! The only unfulfilled Christmas wish : A kitten, which I will gift myself the second I can. </p>
