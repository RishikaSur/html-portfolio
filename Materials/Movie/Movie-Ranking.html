        <h2>Animated Movies</h2>
        <h3>1. Wall E</h3>
        <p>Depicts todays battle of mankind against advancements in tcehnology, like AI. It gives out a very strong message 
            and shows us that all is never lost, we just need the strength to fight.</p>
        <h3>2. Ratatouille</h3>
        <p>This movie is bound to win your heart if you are a foodie, or just loves to watch cute human-animal interactions
            (even if the said animal is a rat)! </p>
        <h2>Christmas Movies</h2>
        <h3>1. Home Alone</h3>
        <p>What's a boy to do when he finds himself home alone on Christmas? Maybe mess up the house? Or maybe catch theives.
            This movie is a great way to spend Christmas with your family through laughter and joy.
        </p>
        <h3>2. The Grinch</h3>
        <p>Get the milk and cookies ready, and gear up to find your inner Santa with the grumpy Grinch(is he green becaus he is jealous??).
            Ho! Ho! Ho! I love the emotion behind it.
        </p>
        <h2>Action Movies</h2>
        <h3>1. Avengers : The Endgame</h3>
        <p>The finale. The graphics, the sound, there is nothing to complain about. Just need to steal yourself for the heartbreak every time I see it.</p>
